       Making a Call
      h3.section_title.
       Where can I find the rates to the countries I call?
      p.
       Go to Rates to view Arise & Shine's low per-minute calling rates to over 200 countries and locations.
      h3.section_title
       How do I make calls with Arise & Shine?
      p.
       First, you will need a Arise & Shine account with funds for international calling. 
        To make a call, dial the access number you received with your account. When you hear the prompt, dial the number you wish to call. Be sure to include the country code, city code and phone number when you dial. It's that easy.
      h3.section_title.
       Do I need to have my phone service provider enable international calling on my phone to use Arise & Shine?
      p.
       No, the only phone service you need is domestic calling within the U.S. If the calling plan from your phone service provider does not include nationwide U.S. coverage, you may want to check and confirm that calls to your Arise & Shine access number will not incur any additional cost.
      h3.section_title.
       Which Arise & Shine access number should I use?
      p.
       You should use the access number assigned to you when setting up your International Calling service. Most calling plans allow you to call anywhere in the U.S. at the same price. If the calling plan from your phone service provider does not include nationwide U.S. coverage, you may want to check and confirm that calls to your Arise & Shine access number will not incur any additional cost.
      h3.section_title.
       Can I call from other phones using my Arise & Shine account?
      p.
       Yes, of course! If you are going to call frequently from another phone, you can register the phone number with your Arise & Shine account. This way you can allow other family members to use your account from their own phones.
       Even if you don't register a phone, you can still use it with your Arise & Shine account. Simply dial your access number and when prompted enter your registered phone number and your 4-digit security code. Then dial the number you wish to call, beginning with the country code.
      h3.section_title.
       How do I view my call history?
      p.
       Login to your account and go to the Call History page. You can view Arise & Shine calls made within the past 12 months from your phone and all additional phones registered to share your calling balance.
      h3.section_title.
       Can I have an Unlimited Plan in addition to my International Calling service?
      p.
       Yes, you can have both services on your Arise & Shine account. You can sign up for both services at the same time or add a service later in the account center.
       Unlimited Plans
      h3.section_title.
       What is the difference between an Unlimited Plan and the International Calling service?
      p.
       The difference is how you are charged for your calls. When you use the international calling service, the cost of your calls depends on the per-minute rate to the country or location you are calling and the length of your call. The longer the call, the more you are charged. You are charged for every call you make, and the charges are deducted from your calling balance.
       An Unlimited plan provides unlimited calling to several countries or locations. For one low price, you can call any (or all) of the plan locations and talk as long as you like while the plan is active. There are no additional charges when calling in-plan locations.
      h3.section_title.
       Why isn't the country I call included in an Unlimited Plan?
      p.
       Unfortunately, we aren't able to include every country in our Unlimited Plans. You can still take advantage of our low international rates and great call quality by using our international calling service.
       If you are only interested in an Unlimited Plan, we do enhance our services regularly, so please check our website in the future.
      h3.section_title.
       How do I know when my Unlimited Plan will expire?
      p.
       To find out your expiration date and other information about your plan, login to your Arise & Shine account. From the account center you can renew your plan and also set up Auto Renewal, so you never need to worry about your plan expiring.
      h3.section_title.
       How do I renew my Unlimited Plan?
      p.
       Login to the account center and go to the Manage Your Services section. From there, you will be able to review the details of your plan and renew it. You can also set up Auto Renewal, so you never need to worry about your plan expiring.
      h3.section_title.
       Can I cancel an Unlimited Plan?
      p.
       Yes, you may cancel your plan by contacting customer service. Please note that there are no refunds of the plan fee once you purchase or renew an Unlimited Plan.
      h3.section_title.
       Can I use my Unlimited Plan from any phone?
      p.
       Your Unlimited Plan can only be used from the phone number you registered when you purchased the plan or when you set up your Arise & Shine account.
       Additional phone numbers you might have registered to share your International Calling service will not be able to use your Unlimited Plan.
      h3.section_title.
       Can I use the International Calling service in addition to having an Unlimited Plan?
      p.
       Yes, you can have both services. If you need to call out-of-plan locations, you can add funds to your Arise & Shine account for International Calling.
       You'll be charged our low per-minute rates for out-of-plan calls, and the cost will be deducted from your calling balance.
